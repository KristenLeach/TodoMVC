Pre-planning 

1. Integrate basic theme to asset pipeline 
2. Allow people to CRUD lists; create a list, see all lists, show a list.

--I want people to be able to create lists, then they should be able to add items to those lists. They should be able to nav many lists, see each list's items. 
    Models: 
    lists -has many items
    items -belongs to a list
